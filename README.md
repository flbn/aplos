# aplós

aplós is a simple static site generator built with node.js. aplós means simple in greek.

all static site generators claim to be 'small' and/or 'simple' solutions, but you end up having to bend your website's logic to the will of whatever technical decision the original creators made. in essence, that is all software. anyway, i had enough so i built my own. why study documentation for a couple of hours when you can create your own static site generator and study the documentation of the tools you're using for days [haha, totally not weeks]?

*sigh*

also, why program if you don't build your own tools? it's fun this way, you can build a tiny universe with your computer. some day i'll revisit this project and refactor it with deno and typescript. for now, node and vanilla js do the job very well.
