# pages

add your markdown (or HTML) that you want to be rendered here. this folder also accepts nested folders. for instance, you could make a directory in here like this:
```
blog/hello.md
```
and the output would be
```
blog/hello.html
```

an example of the index page has been placed here. you'll want to delete this readme.
